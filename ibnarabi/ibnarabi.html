            <p>
                The role of pre-modern mystical Islam, known as Sufism, on the formation of today’s variety in Islam is perhaps more significant
                than was thought before. In the provocative book What is Islam?, Shahab Ahmed argued that Ibn ʿArabī (d.
                1240), a central Sufi intellectual, had a lasting and pervasive impact on Islamic culture. Even more remarkable,
                Khaled El-Rouayheb has recently argued that the followers of Ibn ʿArabī were responsible for enkindling the
                reformist movement called Salafism, which is at the root of many of today’s geopolitical issues concerning
                the Islamic world. Both authors propose their theses with broad strokes, resulting in tantalizing questions
                more than definitive answers. This hesitant attitude is understandable, as the state of knowledge on Ibn
                ʿArabī’s influence is rudimentary, mostly still hidden in manuscripts. My project, Ibn ʿArabī’s Reshaping
                of the Muslim Imagination, aims to give substance to this claim, by investigating Ibn ʿArabī’s key idea of
                the imagination, and the influence it had on later thinkers up until today. For Ibn ʿArabī, imagination explains
                the multiplicity of creation and its characteristic of constantly going in and out of existence. For him,
                God alone truly exists; the actual creation is a mere act of imagination of Him. Humans can therefore penetrate
                the truth of existence best through their imaginative faculty of imagination, not their intellectual faculty.
                This reconceptualization of what imagination is and what it can do are nothing short of revolutionary, as
                has been pointed out before. In my previous research, I happened to notice that crucial elements of Ibn ʿArabī’s
                thinking on the imagination appear in dozens of texts throughout the centuries up until today, from all corners
                of the Islamic world, and from a variety of disciplines. It is tempting to read this as evidence of a lively
                ongoing debate, but in my doctoral research I interpreted a similar phenomenon differently, thereby arguing
                for a far reduced influence of another thinker as has been assumed before. Whatever the case may turn out
                to be for Ibn ʿArabī, by following the elements of this doctrine in texts of poetry, mysticism, theology,
                and philosophy, the social network underlying this influence can be uncovered. With this, we are one important
                step closer to understand the role of Sufism in early-modern Islam, and its influence on contemporary Islam.

                <a id="background"></a>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Ibn ʿArabī was born in 1165 in Murcia, Spain and died in Damascus in 1240. He travelled extensively, most famously to Mecca
                which inspired him to write the massive ‘The Meccan conquests’ (al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya), which in a recent
                edition runs to 12 big volumes. He wrote his other famous work in Damascus and called it ‘The ringstones
                of wisdom (al-Fusus al-hikam), which is a frustratingly terse book. Both works seemed to have been an instant
                sensation, arguing for an entirely new system of thought that nevertheless cohered to traditional Islamic
                notions. His writings can be called ‘theoretical Sufism,’ meaning that Ibn ʿArabī was a mystic and wrote
                from within the Sufi paradigm, yet did not restrict himself to manuals of ascetic practice and love poetry,
                but spent most of his ink on the big philosophical questions such as ‘what is existence,’ and ‘what is knowledge.’
                At the center of Ibn ʿArabī’s thought is the idea that only God exists; something that later became known
                as wahdat al-wujud: the unity of existence. Everything else is ambiguous; both existence and non-existence
                can be applied to them. Everything other than God is therefore called ‘absolute imagination’ (khayal mutlaq).
                He invents two other notions. One is our own faculty of imagination, now called ‘the attached imagination’
                (khayal mutassil). In between these two stands ‘the detached imagination’ (khayal munfasil). This is a realm
                that has a bridging function (as an isthmus, barzakh) between the spiritual, immaterial part of being and
                the bodily, material part of it. Ibn ʿArabī became known as al-shaykh al-akbar, “the greatest mystic.” Soon
                after him, a commentary tradition proliferated, which seems to number in the hundreds, written up until today.
                The most influential ones have been edited, and in preliminary research I found out that in the first two
                centuries after Ibn ʿArabī, there was a lively debate about how to formalize and further develop his thinking
                on the imagination. In my doctoral research I investigated post-classical Islamic philosophy, on a topic
                in eschatology that touched on the notion of imagination. This led me to stumble upon dozens of authors from
                all walks of life using Ibn ʿArabī’s notion. They are as diverse as the sufi ʿAbd al-Karīm Jīlī, the Shīʿī
                theologian Sayyid Ḥaydar Āmulī, the Ottoman intellectual Shams al-Dīn Fanārī, the Indian reformist thinker
                Shāh Walī Allāh’s, and the late Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khomeini.

            <p>
                I adopt a two-pronged strategy: close reading and distant reading. Close reading requires little elaboration, as it is simply
                the strategy to read one source closely, often focusing only on certain parts of a source or even just a
                few sentences, rephrasing the contents in modern language in order to clarify and analyze it. Its goal is
                to understand the text as fully as possible, not only for the ideas it is proposing and the arguments it
                is making, but also the argumentation strategies that underlie it and the motivations to include or exclude
                certain terms, arguments, and topics. Distant reading is, as I have appropriated it, a combination of Digital
                Humanities and Literary Theory, by which I string together texts that exhibit a certain textual fragment
                such as a technical term or a sentence. The implementation is a mixed strategy of database searches and going
                through printed and manuscript material by hand. Islamic Studies is still transitioning to incorporate digital
                tools in research and in this project I will develop new methodological approaches, especially in trying
                to automatize searches to a greater degree than is possible now. The goal of distant reading is twofold:
                1) to find new, unexpected sources that prove to be relevant for further close reading, 2) to understand
                which text influenced which, eventually establishing a genealogy of how all texts relate to each other. I
                use databases such as al-Maktaba al-Shamila and Noorlib which combined contain between ten to fifteen thousand
                works. I shall subsequently look through editions of important texts from poetry, mysticism, theology, and
                philosophy. In particular, I shall draw from Ibn ʿArabī’s corpus and the edited commentaries thereon. Additionally,
                I shall look up manuscripts of unedited commentaries which are from the first two centuries. I have experience
                with accessing manuscript collections such as Leiden, Berlin, Istanbul, and Tehran and expect no problem
                here. In total I would be looking through thousands of digital texts, hundreds of printed texts, and dozens
                of manuscripts. This is manageable because I already know the key concepts and key ideas I need to look for.
                Thus, for the digital texts I only look at passages with certain technical terms such as khayal munfasil
                or barzakh. For the printed sources a similar reductive strategy applies: the primary place where imagination
                is discussed is predictable. For example, the commentaries upon Fusus al-hikam all discuss imagination in
                the chapter called “The Ringstone of Joseph.”

                The outcome is a book, two articles, and two conferences. The book consists of two parts: one on Ibn ʿArabī ‘s commentators,
                and one on the authors at large influenced by him. In the first part I focus on the commentaries from the
                13th and 14th century (19 in total). This has never been done before, indeed many of these texts have never
                been used in modern scholarship. I supplement the discussion with commentaries from later centuries, that
                are either highly influential or provide an interesting alternative point of view. In the second part I describe
                the distant reading techniques that I have utilized, I describe and analyze the social network that comes
                forth from this, and I discuss two or three important cases. One article examines the influence on poetry.
                I base my selection on suggestions from secondary literature. Another article examines the influence on contemporary
                Islamic thinking, in particular how Ibn ʿArabī’s concept of imagination is used for identity building by
                both Western and Muslim thinkers. In one conference I wish to invite scholars in the Netherlands to reflect
                on the connection between premodern and modern Islam, especially as this relates to Salafism. In another
                conference I wish to invite international scholars on Ibn ʿArabī and his position in post-classical Islamic
                thought.
