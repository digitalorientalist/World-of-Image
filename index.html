        'The world of image',
        <i>ʿālam al-mithāl</i>, also referred to as 'imaginal world', is a concept developed by medieval Islamic intellectuals.
        It is highly innovative and finds no direct ancestor in Greek philosophy, nor even a distant cousin in any other
        culture. Studying this notion is one of the key ways to dismantle the narrative that the Islamic world entered a
        dark age after the 11th century, from which it never recovered. Reading the texts of dozens, indeed hundreds, of
        Muslim thinkers through the centuries of the Late Medieval and Early Modern period, paints a picture of a lively
        debate of the highest caliber. Since many of these texts have been forgotten and only survived us in manuscripts,
        there is a lot of work to be done to find out exactly how discussions around this notion came about and developed.
        <br> It seems to me that the notion was picked up in four distinctly different ways. Each of these four ways will be
        subject to an investigation through a project. One is already completed, the second is on the way.
        <br>
        <b>1. </b>The first way is how the philosopher Suhrawardī (d. 1191) and his commentators developed the notion. They
        eventually propose this term to denote a world beyond our earthly world, to be reached in sleep, meditation or after
        death. This world of image consists of non-physical (imagined) bodies, providing a philosophical interpretation of
        bodily resurrection.
        <br>
        <b>2. </b>Ibn ʿArabī (d. 1240), the great mystic who had a tremendous influence on Islamic culture, together with his
        commentators, also uses the notion, but in a different way. For them, the world of image explains the multiplicity
        of creation and its characteristic of constantly going in and out of existence. If God alone truly exists, then
        the actual creation is a mere act of imagination of Him. Humans can therefore penetrate the truth of existence best
        through their imaginative faculty of imagination, not their intellectual faculty.

            <p>My name is L.W. Cornelis van Lit. I also go by Eric. I grew up in the Netherlands where I studied Mathematics,
                Philosophy, and Arabic. In my masters in Islamic Studies at McGill University, I first encountered the notion
                of a 'world of image'. In my dissertation I focussed on it a lot, eventually deciding to make it the focus
                of my first book. Next to working on stage two of my life-long commitment to work on the world of image,
                I also work on other parts of Islamic philosophy, notably the influence of al-Ghazālī's
                <i>Tahāfut al-falāsifa</i>. I am also experienced in Digital Humanities, about which I write on my website
