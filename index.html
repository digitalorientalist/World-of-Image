                        'The world of image',
                        <i>ʿālam al-mithāl</i>, also referred to as 'imaginal world', is a concept developed by medieval Islamic
                        intellectuals. It is highly innovative and finds no direct ancestor in Greek philosophy, nor even
                        a distant cousin in any other culture. Studying this notion is one of the key ways to dismantle the
                        narrative that the Islamic world entered a dark age after the 11th century, from which it supposedly
                        never recovered.
                        <br> It seems to me that the notion was picked up in four distinctly different ways. Each of these four
                        ways will be subject to an investigation through a project. The first two projects are described
                        below.

                                <b>1. </b>The first way is how the philosopher Suhrawardī (d. 1191) and his commentators developed
                                the notion. They eventually propose this term to denote a world beyond our earthly world,
                                to be reached in sleep, meditation or after death. This world of image consists of non-physical
                                (imagined) bodies, providing a philosophical interpretation of bodily resurrection.</p>

                                <b>2. </b>Ibn ʿArabī (d. 1240), the great mystic who had a tremendous influence on Islamic culture,
                                together with his commentators, also uses the notion, but in a different way. For them, the
                                world of image explains the multiplicity of creation and its characteristic of constantly
                                going in and out of existence. If God alone truly exists, then the actual creation is a mere
                                act of imagination of Him. Humans can therefore penetrate the truth of existence best through
                                their imaginative faculty of imagination, not their intellectual faculty.

                        <p>My name is L.W. Cornelis van Lit. I also go by Eric. I grew up in the Netherlands where I studied
                            Mathematics, Philosophy, and Arabic. In my masters in Islamic Studies at McGill University, I
                            first encountered the notion of a 'world of image'. In my dissertation I focussed on it a lot,
                            eventually deciding to make it the focus of my first book. Next to working on stage two of my
                            life-long commitment to work on the world of image, I also work on other parts of Islamic philosophy,
                            notably the influence of al-Ghazālī's
                            <i>Tahāfut al-falāsifa</i>. I am also experienced in Digital Humanities, about which I write on
                            my website
                            <a href="http://www.digitalorientalist.com/">The Digital Orientalist</a>. </p>
